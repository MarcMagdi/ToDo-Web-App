# ToDo-Web-App
A To do web application platform for managing users tasks implementing Google's Material Design for both UI &amp; UX.

### Project Features: 
As a user I have the ability to: 
+ Register and login into the application and navigate to my dashboard.
+ Add an in progress task providing title, optional description and due date.
+ Edit all task fields or even delete it completely.
+ Mark any task as completed, or to archive the task.
+ Navigate to any of my tasks lists [All Tasks - InProgress - Completed - Archived]

### Technical Perspective:
To-do list is mainly a NodeJS - JavaScript application, it stores users information and tasks in JSON files. It uses Material Design Bootstrap for the user interface. The connection between the front end and the backend is based on REST APIs using AJAX and Express Server.
